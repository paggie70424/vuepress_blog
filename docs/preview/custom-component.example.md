Welcome to Paggie's Blog!


I am Paggie from **Taiwan**, currently residing in Adelaide, South Australia. Since 2017, I took a gap year after my second year at Chung Shan Medical University in Taiwan. I decided to experience the snow season in Australia, so I stayed in the snow-covered mountains of Melbourne for four months before resuming my studies in Adelaide.

I started my academic journey as a **medical informatics student** at Chung Shan Medical University in Taiwan, then switched to studying commerce with a focus on **marketing** at The University of Adelaide. Currently, I am pursuing a **data science** major at the University of South Australia. I also work in the Future Work Department at UniSA now, where my responsibilities cover backend, frontend, and data analysis.
